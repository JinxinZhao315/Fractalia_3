## Motivation: 
*Recursion*, beautiful and charming in Nature and Mathematics, is the best friend (worst nightmare) for many CS students, especially those in NUS. 
Inspired by the interesting missions and quests throughout our CS modules, we decided to design a game to demonstrate the fun aspects and the beauty of recursion through fractals.
Through this game, we also want to show our appreciation towards historical figures who contributed to the study of recursion, mathematics and computer science, and impart players with knowledge about such scientific history.

## Project Summary
Fractalia is a 3D shooter game with fractal maps for the player to explore while defeating enemies named Bugs that have polluted the fractal world and stolen important files. 
Meanwhile, the player needs to piece together the broken files using their knowledge of recursion tree -- whether they learned it from CS or this game itself.

## Game Design

### Story Background:
“The Land of Fractals (aka Fractalia) used to live in perfect harmony, and our wise Prophets continuously guided the mortals towards Truth across millennia. 
But one day, in his reckless experiments, a careless Scribe (aka programmer) opened a backdoor and unleashed hordes of Bugs upon our Heaven! 
They have wreaked havoc and caused untold pain and suffering for our innocent residents. Even worse, they cause nightmares and mental breakdowns for people on the mortal plane. 
If we don’t stop them, they threaten to destroy the fabric of Mathematics which may lead to the collapse of Reality itself.”

### Player Task:
1. Traverse different fractal iteration levels through **Portals**.
1. Defeat **Bugs** (enemies) in shooting combat. May pick up helpful **Quest Items** such as health potions and shields in the map to help with combat.
1. After Bugs die, the player can access the **Terminals** they guard, which contain fragments of the **Sacred Texts** that have been recursively split apart by Bugs.
1. After collecting Sacred Texts from each terminal, figure out where each fragment fits into the recursion tree, and **Combine Texts** accordingly.
1. After successfully combining all texts at the tree root, enjoy a piece of in-game mythology :)
